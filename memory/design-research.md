## 1. Along Dusty Roads
**Website:** alongdustyroads.com
**Client likes:** Color grading and content segregation

### Color Palette
- **Background:** Warm cream/beige
- **Accent:** Terracotta/copper for headings and links
- **Text:** Dark charcoal for body copy
- **Overall feel:** Warm, earthy, muted tones

### Typography
- **Logo/Headings:** Serif font (elegant, editorial)
- **Navigation:** Clean sans-serif
- **Body:** Sans-serif, good readability

### Photo Style / Color Grading
- Consistent warm color temperature across all photos
- Slightly muted/desaturated look
- Earth tones enhanced: terracotta, teal water, warm sand, browns
- Creates cohesive visual identity even with diverse locations

### Content Segregation
- **Hierarchy:** Region → Country → Destination
- Clear visual separation between sections
- Generous whitespace
- Full-width imagery sections alternating with text sections

### Layout Patterns

#### Homepage Sections:
1. **Hero:** Full-width landscape image
2. **Intro:** "Hello Traveller" welcome text
3. **Destination Carousel:** Horizontal slider with portrait images, region category labels (Europe, Asia, etc.)
4. **Country Feature:** Split layout - large image (60%) + text content with CTA
5. **Story Slider:** Full-width image with title overlay and "/ read" link
6. **Blog Grid:** 2-column, minimal cards (image + title only)
7. **Instagram CTA:** "follow us on instagram" with hand-drawn oval
8. **Footer:** 3-column (About + Destinations list + Newsletter)

### Distinctive Elements
- **Hand-drawn accents:** Oval/pill outlines around key phrases
- **Wave doodles:** Used as decorative elements and brand identity
- **Curved section dividers:** Subtle wave shapes between sections
- **Minimal blog cards:** No shadows, no heavy borders - just image + title
- **Simple CTAs:** Text links like "/ read" instead of buttons

### Navigation
- Simple top nav: HOME, ABOUT, BLOG, PLACES
- Logo centered
- Social icons on right (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube)
- Footer has destination quick links
